5 trainings availables with "how to" in the file (.pdf). The excel sheet (.xlsx) gives the theoritical calaculus. 

objectives : Learning main simulation procedures for RF building blocks design.

  SIMULATION OBJECTIVES
  - SP simulations (Matching, Noise analysis, ...)
  - HP simualtions (IIP3, IPC1dB)
  - HB-AC simulation (Mixer frequency response)
  - HB-SP and HB-Noise for Mixer NF
  - Phase noise simulations
  DESIGN OBJECTIVES
  - Matching
  - LNA Design (inductive degeneration)
  - Mixer Design
  - LO Design (LC - VCO)
  - PA Design

Technolgie : (AMS 0.35 um). The training focuses on tools. Other PDK could be used.
