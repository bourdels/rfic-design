5 trainings available with "how to" in the file (.pdf). The excel sheet (.xlsx) gives the theoretical caliculus. 

objectives: Learning main simulation procedures for RF building blocks design.

  SIMULATION OBJECTIVES
  - SP simulations (Matching, Noise analysis, ...)
  - HP simulations (IIP3, IPC1dB)
  - HB-AC simulation (Mixer frequency response)
  - HB-SP and HB-Noise for Mixer NF
  - Phase noise simulations
  DESIGN OBJECTIVES
  - Matching
  - LNA Design (inductive degeneration)
  - Mixer Design
  - LO Design (LC - VCO)
  - PA Design

Technologies : (AMS 0.35 um). The training focuses on tools. Other PDK could be used.
